Hello, My name is Matthias Hartmann, I'm 19 years old and I'm currently studying Networks and Telecommunications thanks to a sandwich course in the I.U.T of Lannion in France. During my free time i like practicing fencing or playing video games. But what i love doing is programming. This why i aspire to be a Software developer. That's why I've been learning, studying and focusing on aquiring Computer skills.


--Second part : Skills / Education--

Thanks to my sandwich course in Networks engineering and telecommunications i've earned loads of differents skills such as setting up a local area network and managing it or understand the protocols that rule internet. Moreover I'm also skilled in Programming. I've been programming since I'm twelve, during that time I learned quite a lot of programming languages, Python Javascript, Java beeing the main ones. I do have hands on experience on differents programming tools like GitHub to organise my projects or VisualStudioCode to program on. Theses skills make me a polyvent asset in an IT field.

To mobilize thoses skills i've participated in multiples projects during my course and personal time. The latest was developing a web tool to display data.
