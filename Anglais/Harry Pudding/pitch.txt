	Visual
		When watching the movie, the audience will surely be amazed by the amount of work put in the desing of the costumes, the places where the scenes were shot but more importantly the ambience of the lighting.
		Our intention were to deliver a show where the audience is completly immerged. They will feel the pain of the characters and be relieved when good things happen.
		An other thing about the visual is that we put great effort on combining different methods of filming and a good use of video montage to convey all the character and places' emotions to the audience.
